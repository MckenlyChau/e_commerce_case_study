**Insight:** Negative `quantity`, likely refunds.

### üîª Negative Quantities Without ‚ÄòC‚Äô Invoices
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM e_commerce_events 
WHERE quantity < 0 AND invoice_no NOT LIKE 'C%';
```
|invoice_no|stock_code|description|quantity|unit_price|total_spend|customer_id|country        |invoice_date       |
|----------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|-----------|-----------|---------------|-------------------|

***Insight:** Possible damaged goods or stock adjustments.

### üß™ Sample Checks
```sql
SELECT * FROM e_commerce_events WHERE stock_code = '85175';
SELECT * FROM e_commerce_events WHERE invoice_no = '541993';
SELECT * FROM e_commerce_events WHERE stock_code = '21035';
```
**Insight:** Pricing anomalies and missing `customer_id` suggest outliers.

### üî£ Non-Item Stock Codes
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT stock_code
FROM e_commerce_events
WHERE stock_code NOT REGEXP '[0-9]';
```
|stock_code  |
|------------|
|POST        |
|D           |
|M           |
|BANK CHARGES|
|PADS        |
|DOT         |

### üïí Convert Date Formats
```sql
ALTER TABLE e_commerce_events ADD invoice_dt DATETIME;
UPDATE e_commerce_events
SET invoice_dt = STR_TO_DATE(invoice_date, '%m/%d/%Y %H:%i');
ALTER TABLE e_commerce_events DROP COLUMN invoice_date;
ALTER TABLE e_commerce_events CHANGE invoice_dt invoice_date DATETIME;
```

### üíæ Create Backup Before Modifications

```sql
UPDATE e_commerce_events
SET invoice_no = 
  CASE
    WHEN invoice_no LIKE 'C%' THEN SUBSTRING(invoice_no, 2)
    ELSE invoice_no
  END;
ALTER TABLE e_commerce_events
MODIFY invoice_no INT;
```
***Insight:** Adjusted for clarity

```sql
ALTER TABLE e_commerce_events
ADD COLUMN invoice_date_only DATE,
ADD COLUMN invoice_time_only TIME;
UPDATE e_commerce_events
SET
  invoice_date_only = DATE(invoice_date),
  invoice_time_only = TIME(invoice_date);
ALTER TABLE e_commerce_events
DROP COLUMN invoice_date;
ALTER TABLE e_commerce_events
CHANGE invoice_date_only invoice_date DATE,
CHANGE invoice_time_only invoice_time TIME;
```
***Insight:** Separated for easier analysis.

### üßπ Column Order Cleanup
```sql
ALTER TABLE e_commerce_events 
MODIFY COLUMN invoice_date DATE AFTER invoice_no;
ALTER TABLE e_commerce_events 
MODIFY COLUMN invoice_time TIME AFTER invoice_date;
ALTER TABLE e_commerce_events 
MODIFY COLUMN customer_id INT AFTER invoice_time;
ALTER TABLE e_commerce_events

**Insight:** Several customers have an overall_spend of 0, which likely indicates full refunds or fully reversed transactions. Similarly, an overall_quantity of 0 may reflect historical refunds or data entry anomalies. Since these records do not provide meaningful analytical value, they may be excluded in later stages of the analysis.

**Insight:** Orders from the United Kingdom significantly surpass other countries in both quantity and total spend, which aligns with the dataset‚Äôs UK origin. Countries with fewer customers often exhibit a higher average spend per customer, suggesting that international sales may have been limited to wholesale buyers operating in their own domestic markets. It may be valuable to distinguish between domestic and international transactions for clearer segmentation.

**Insight:** The highest overall quantity and total spend are concentrated in the latter half of the year, indicating a potential seasonal trend. This pattern suggests increased purchasing activity during certain months, likely related to holidays or year-end demand. Further analysis by month and season will help validate and understand these trends.

#### üß† Customer Segmentation by Type
```sql
ALTER TABLE valid_customers
ADD COLUMN customer_type VARCHAR(20);

UPDATE valid_customers
SET customer_type = 
  CASE
    WHEN overall_quantity > 5000
         AND (overall_quantity / invoice_count) > 100
         AND overall_spend > 10000 THEN 'Wholesaler'
	WHEN overall_quantity > 2000
         AND (overall_quantity / invoice_count) > 50
         AND overall_spend > 1000 THEN 'Micro-Wholesaler'
    ELSE 'Retail'
  END;
```
**Insight:** Customers with an overall quantity exceeding 5,000, an average of more than 100 items per invoice, and total spending above 10,000 strongly indicate wholesale purchasing behavior. Meanwhile, those with over 2,000 items, an average above 50 per invoice, and spending above 1,000 suggest micro-wholesale activity. These thresholds help distinguish wholesalers from regular retail customers by identifying consistent patterns in purchase volume and value.

### üìà Customer Segmentation by Engagement
```sql
ALTER TABLE valid_customers
ADD COLUMN customer_level VARCHAR(20);

UPDATE valid_customers
SET customer_level = 
  CASE
  WHEN invoice_count = 1 THEN 'One-Time'
  WHEN invoice_count < 3 AND customer_tenure_days < 30 THEN 'Short-Term'
  WHEN invoice_count >= 3 AND customer_tenure_days < 90 THEN 'Medium-Term'
  WHEN invoice_count >= 5 AND customer_tenure_days >= 90 THEN 'Recurrent'
  ELSE 'Occasional'
END;
```
**Insight:** Customers are categorized into engagement levels based on the number of days between their first and last transactions `customer_tenure_days` and their total number of invoices `invoice_count`. This segmentation helps classify them as One-Time, Short-Term, Medium-Term, Recurrent, or Occasional customers, providing a clearer understanding of purchasing behavior and loyalty.

#### üí∞ Product Tier Assignment by Price
```sql
ALTER TABLE products
ADD COLUMN product_level VARCHAR(20);

UPDATE products
SET product_level = 
  CASE
    WHEN usual_price > 100 THEN 'Premium'
    WHEN usual_price > 50 THEN 'High'
    WHEN usual_price > 10 THEN 'Mid'
    WHEN usual_price > 1 THEN 'Standard'
    ELSE 'Low'
  END;
```
**Insight:** Products are categorized into tiers‚ÄîPremium, High, Mid, Standard, and Low‚Äîbased on their `usual_price` to reflect relative pricing levels and support more granular product analysis.

#### üìÖ Add Month and Month Number
```sql
ALTER TABLE dates
ADD COLUMN month_number TINYINT,
ADD COLUMN month_name VARCHAR(10);

UPDATE dates
SET 
  month_number = MONTH(invoice_date),
  month_name = DATE_FORMAT(invoice_date, '%b');
  
  ALTER TABLE dates
MODIFY COLUMN month_number TINYINT AFTER invoice_date,
MODIFY COLUMN month_name VARCHAR(10) AFTER month_number;
```
**Insight:** Added month_number and month_name columns to enhance time-based analysis and enable proper chronological sorting in monthly reports.

#### üìä Monthly Trends Summary Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE months AS
SELECT 
  month_number,
  month_name,
  SUM(invoice_count) AS invoice_count,
  SUM(customer_count) AS customer_count,
  SUM(overall_quantity) AS overall_quantity,
  SUM(overall_spend) AS overall_spend
FROM dates
GROUP BY month_number, month_name
ORDER BY month_number;
