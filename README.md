## 🧪 Data Audit

### Date Range
```sql
SELECT MIN(invoice_date), MAX(invoice_date)
FROM e_commerce_events;
```
|MIN(invoice_date)  |MAX(invoice_date)  |
|-------------------|-------------------|
|2010-12-01 08:26:00|2011-12-09 12:50:00|


### High-Level Overview
```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) AS total_rows,
  COUNT(DISTINCT invoice_no) AS unique_invoices,
  COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS unique_customers,
  COUNT(DISTINCT stock_code) AS unique_products
FROM e_commerce_events;
```
|total_rows|unique_invoices|unique_customers|unique_products|
|----------|---------------|----------------|---------------|
|541909    |25900          |4372            |3958           |

### Detect Duplicates
```sql
WITH dup_cte AS (
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS dup_count
  FROM e_commerce_events
  GROUP BY invoice_no, stock_code, description, quantity, invoice_date, unit_price, customer_id, country
  HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
)
SELECT SUM(dup_count - 1) AS redundant_rows
FROM dup_cte;
```
|redundant_rows|
|--------------|
|5268          |


### NULL Values
```sql
SELECT *
FROM e_commerce_events
WHERE invoice_no IS NULL 
OR stock_code IS NULL 
OR description IS NULL
OR quantity IS NULL 
OR unit_price IS NULL 
OR customer_id IS NULL
OR country IS NULL 
OR invoice_date IS NULL;
```
|invoice_no|stock_code|description                    |quantity|unit_price|total_spend|customer_id|country        |invoice_date       |
|----------|----------|-------------------------------|--------|----------|-----------|-----------|---------------|-------------------|

**Insight:** Only `customer_id` contains NULLs.

### Zero Unit Price
```sql
SELECT *
FROM e_commerce_events
WHERE unit_price = 0;
```
|invoice_no|stock_code|description                    |quantity|unit_price|total_spend|customer_id|country        |invoice_date       |
|----------|----------|-------------------------------|--------|----------|-----------|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
|536414    |22139     |                               |56      |0.00      |0.00       |NULL       |United Kingdom |2010-12-01 11:52:00|
|536545    |21134     |                               |1       |0.00      |0.00       |NULL       |United Kingdom |2010-12-01 14:32:00|

**Insight:** Often paired with NULL `customer_id`; may indicate bundled items.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM e_commerce_events
WHERE unit_price = 0 AND customer_id IS NOT NULL;
```
|invoice_no|stock_code|description                    |quantity|unit_price|total_spend|customer_id|country        |invoice_date       |

**Insight:** Valid customers with free items — likely promotional.

### High price items
```sql
SELECT *
FROM e_commerce_events
ORDER BY unit_price DESC
LIMIT 200;
```
|invoice_no|stock_code|description                    |quantity|unit_price|total_spend|customer_id|country        |invoice_date       |

***Insight:** Highest value items include mainly Manuals and AMAZON fees. They also have negative quantities. Will consider deleting.

### Refunds (Invoices with 'C')
```sql
SELECT * FROM e_commerce_events WHERE invoice_no LIKE 'C%';
```
|invoice_no|stock_code|description                    |quantity|unit_price|total_spend|customer_id|country        |invoice_date       |
|----------|----------|-------------------------------|--------|----------|-----------|-----------|---------------|-------------------|

**Insight:** Negative `quantity`, likely refunds.

### Negative Quantities Without 'C'
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM e_commerce_events 
WHERE quantity < 0 AND invoice_no NOT LIKE 'C%';
```
|invoice_no|stock_code|description|quantity|unit_price|total_spend|customer_id|country        |invoice_date       |
|----------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|-----------|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
|537032    |21275     |?          |-30     |0.00      |0.00       |NULL       |United Kingdom |2010-12-03 16:50:00|

***Insight:** Possible damaged goods or stock adjustments.

### Sample Product Checks
```sql
SELECT * FROM e_commerce_events WHERE stock_code = '85175';
SELECT * FROM e_commerce_events WHERE invoice_no = '541993';
SELECT * FROM e_commerce_events WHERE stock_code = '21035';
```
**Insight:** Pricing anomalies and missing `customer_id` suggest outliers.

### Stock Codes For non-itemproducts
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT stock_code
FROM e_commerce_events
WHERE stock_code NOT REGEXP '[0-9]';
```
|stock_code  |
|------------|
|POST        |
|D           |
|M           |
|BANK CHARGES|
|PADS        |
|DOT         |
|CRUK        |

***Insight:** Includes POST(postage), D(discount), M(manual), BANK CHARGES, DOT(dotcom postage), CRUK(cruk commission), and PADS

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning

### Reformat `invoice_date`
```sql
ALTER TABLE e_commerce_events ADD invoice_dt DATETIME;
UPDATE e_commerce_events
SET invoice_dt = STR_TO_DATE(invoice_date, '%m/%d/%Y %H:%i');
ALTER TABLE e_commerce_events DROP COLUMN invoice_date;
ALTER TABLE e_commerce_events CHANGE invoice_dt invoice_date DATETIME;
```

### Backup Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE e_commerce_events_backup AS
SELECT * FROM e_commerce_events;
```
***Insight:** Backing up table before any major changes.

### Create Surrogate id for rows
```sql
ALTER TABLE e_commerce_events
ADD COLUMN id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY FIRST;
```
***Insight:** Applying surrogate id in order to make eliminating duplicates easier

### Delete Duplicate Rows
```sql
WITH duplicate_ids AS (
  SELECT MIN(id) AS keep_id
  FROM e_commerce_events
  GROUP BY invoice_no, stock_code, description, quantity, invoice_date, unit_price, customer_id, country
)
DELETE FROM e_commerce_events
WHERE id NOT IN (
  SELECT keep_id FROM duplicate_ids
);
```

### Delete rows with NULL customer_id
```sql
DELETE FROM e_commerce_events
WHERE customer_id IS NULL;
```
***Insight:** Unable to attribute to a customer so elimated to remove bad data

### Delete rows with 0.00 unit_price
```sql
DELETE FROM e_commerce_events
WHERE unit_price = 0;
```
***Insight:** As these are additive items they are not necessary for analysis.

### Create Column for Transaction Type
```sql
ALTER TABLE e_commerce_events ADD transaction_type VARCHAR(20);
UPDATE e_commerce_events
SET transaction_type = 
  CASE
    WHEN invoice_no LIKE 'C%' THEN 'Refund'
    WHEN stock_code = 'POST' THEN 'Postage'
    WHEN stock_code = 'D' THEN 'Discount'
    WHEN stock_code = 'M' THEN 'Manual'
    WHEN stock_code = 'BANK CHARGES' THEN 'Bank Charges'
    WHEN stock_code = 'DOT' THEN 'Dotcom Postage'
    WHEN stock_code = 'CRUK' THEN 'CRUK Commission'
    WHEN stock_code = 'PADS' THEN 'Pads'
    ELSE 'Purchase'
  END;
UPDATE e_commerce_events
SET stock_code = NULL
WHERE stock_code IN ('POST', 'D', 'M', 'BANK CHARGES', 'DOT', 'CRUK', 'PADS');
```
***Insight:** Adjusted for clarity

### Remove c from invoice_no
```sql
UPDATE e_commerce_events
SET invoice_no = 
  CASE
    WHEN invoice_no LIKE 'C%' THEN SUBSTRING(invoice_no, 2)
    ELSE invoice_no
  END;
ALTER TABLE e_commerce_events
MODIFY invoice_no INT;
```
***Insight:** Adjusted for clarity

### Trimmed and lowercased description for uniformity
```sql
UPDATE e_commerce_events
SET description = LOWER(TRIM(description));
```

### Splitting date and time
```sql
ALTER TABLE e_commerce_events
ADD COLUMN invoice_date_only DATE,
ADD COLUMN invoice_time_only TIME;
UPDATE e_commerce_events
SET
  invoice_date_only = DATE(invoice_date),
  invoice_time_only = TIME(invoice_date);
ALTER TABLE e_commerce_events
DROP COLUMN invoice_date;
ALTER TABLE e_commerce_events
CHANGE invoice_date_only invoice_date DATE,
CHANGE invoice_time_only invoice_time TIME;
```
***Insight:** Separated for easier analysis.

### Rearange for clarity
```sql
ALTER TABLE e_commerce_events 
MODIFY COLUMN invoice_date DATE AFTER invoice_no;
ALTER TABLE e_commerce_events 
MODIFY COLUMN invoice_time TIME AFTER invoice_date;
ALTER TABLE e_commerce_events 
MODIFY COLUMN customer_id INT AFTER invoice_time;
ALTER TABLE e_commerce_events 
MODIFY COLUMN country VARCHAR(50) AFTER customer_id;
```

### Validating Column types
```sql
DESCRIBE e_commerce_events;
```

**Insight:** All data types are correct for their columns

### High-Level Overview After Cleaning
```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) AS total_rows,
  COUNT(DISTINCT invoice_no) AS unique_invoices,
  COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS unique_customers,
  COUNT(DISTINCT stock_code) AS unique_products
FROM e_commerce_events;
```
|total_rows|unique_invoices|unique_customers                  |unique_products|
|----------|---------------|----------------------------------|---------------|
|401560    |22186          |4371                              |3677           |

### Creating Indexs for main search columns
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_customer_id ON e_commerce_events(customer_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_invoice_no ON e_commerce_events(invoice_no);
CREATE INDEX idx_stock_code ON e_commerce_events(stock_code);
CREATE INDEX idx_invoice_date ON e_commerce_events(invoice_date);
```
**Insight:** for ease of use when searching

## 🔄 Data Manipulation

### Add Total Spend Column
```sql
ALTER TABLE e_commerce_events ADD total_spend DECIMAL(10,2);
UPDATE e_commerce_events
SET total_spend = unit_price * quantity;
ALTER TABLE e_commerce_events 
MODIFY COLUMN total_spend DECIMAL(10,2) AFTER unit_price;
```

### Create table for invoices
```sql
CREATE TABLE invoices AS
SELECT
  invoice_no,
  invoice_date,
  MIN(invoice_time) AS invoice_time,
  customer_id,
  country,
  SUM(quantity) AS overall_quantity,
  SUM(total_spend) AS overall_spend,
  GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT transaction_type ORDER BY transaction_type SEPARATOR ', ') AS transaction_types
FROM e_commerce_events
GROUP BY invoice_no, invoice_date, customer_id, country
ORDER BY invoice_no;
```
|invoice_no|invoice_date|invoice_time                      |customer_id|country        |overall_quantity|overall_spend|transaction_types|

### Create table for customers
```sql
CREATE TABLE customers AS
SELECT
  customer_id,
  MIN(invoice_date) AS earliest_transaction_date,
  MAX(invoice_date) AS latest_transaction_date,
  DATEDIFF(MAX(invoice_date), MIN(invoice_date)) AS customer_tenure_days,
  COUNT(DISTINCT invoice_no) AS invoice_count,
  GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT country ORDER BY country SEPARATOR ', ') AS countries,
  SUM(quantity) AS overall_quantity,
  SUM(total_spend) AS overall_spend,
  GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT transaction_type ORDER BY transaction_type SEPARATOR ', ') AS transaction_types
FROM e_commerce_events
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY customer_id;
```
|customer_id|earliest_transaction_date|latest_transaction_date|customer_tenure_days|invoice_count  |countries      |overall_quantity|overall_spend|transaction_types|

**Insight:** Several customers have an overall_spend of 0, which likely indicates full refunds or fully reversed transactions. Similarly, an overall_quantity of 0 may reflect historical refunds or data entry anomalies. Since these records do not provide meaningful analytical value, they may be excluded in later stages of the analysis.

### Create table for valid customers
```sql
CREATE TABLE valid_customers AS
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE overall_spend > 0
AND overall_quantity > 0;
```

	invoice_count,
  countries,
  overall_quantity,
  overall_spend
FROM e_commerce_case_study.valid_customers 
ORDER BY overall_spend DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
|customer_id|customer_tenure_days|invoice_count|countries      |overall_quantity|overall_spend|
|-----------|--------------------|-------------|---------------|----------------|-------------|
|14646      |353                 |76           |Netherlands    |196143          |279489.02    |

**Insight:** Several customers consistently exhibit high order volumes and total spending, indicating potential wholesale buyers or bulk purchasers.

### Investigate customer_id 14646, 18102, 17450
```sql
SELECT * FROM e_commerce_events WHERE customer_id = 14646;
SELECT * FROM e_commerce_events WHERE customer_id = 18102;
SELECT * FROM e_commerce_events WHERE customer_id = 17450;
```
**Insight:** Many of their transactions involve purchasing 100+ units of individual items, reinforcing the likelihood that they are wholesale customers. Further analysis is needed to distinguish wholesalers from regular retail buyers.

### Products
#### Investigate top_selling items By Spend
```sql
SELECT stock_code,
	description,
    overall_quantity,
    average_price,
    lowest_price,
    highest_price,
    usual_price,
    overall_spend
FROM products
ORDER BY overall_spend DESC;
```
|stock_code|description                       |overall_quantity|average_price|lowest_price|highest_price|usual_price|overall_spend|
|----------|----------------------------------|----------------|-------------|------------|-------------|-----------|-------------|

**Insight:** The Regency Cakestand ranks among the top items by `overall_spend`, despite having a lower quantity sold compared to others. This suggests it is a high-value item. Categorizing products into high-end and low-end segments based on `usual_price` may provide more meaningful insights during analysis.

### Investigate top selling items By quantity
```sql
SELECT stock_code,
	description,
    overall_quantity,
    average_price,
    lowest_price,
    highest_price,
    usual_price,
    overall_spend

**Insight:** Orders from the United Kingdom significantly surpass other countries in both quantity and total spend, which aligns with the dataset’s UK origin. Countries with fewer customers often exhibit a higher average spend per customer, suggesting that international sales may have been limited to wholesale buyers operating in their own domestic markets. It may be valuable to distinguish between domestic and international transactions for clearer segmentation.

**Insight:** The highest overall quantity and total spend are concentrated in the latter half of the year, indicating a potential seasonal trend. This pattern suggests increased purchasing activity during certain months, likely related to holidays or year-end demand. Further analysis by month and season will help validate and understand these trends.

## 🧠 Data Enrichment

### Customer
#### Add column for customer_types
```sql
ALTER TABLE valid_customers
ADD COLUMN customer_type VARCHAR(20);

UPDATE valid_customers
SET customer_type = 
  CASE
    WHEN overall_quantity > 5000
         AND (overall_quantity / invoice_count) > 100
         AND overall_spend > 10000 THEN 'Wholesaler'
	WHEN overall_quantity > 2000
         AND (overall_quantity / invoice_count) > 50
         AND overall_spend > 1000 THEN 'Micro-Wholesaler'
    ELSE 'Retail'
  END;
```
**Insight:** Customers with an overall quantity exceeding 5,000, an average of more than 100 items per invoice, and total spending above 10,000 strongly indicate wholesale purchasing behavior. Meanwhile, those with over 2,000 items, an average above 50 per invoice, and spending above 1,000 suggest micro-wholesale activity. These thresholds help distinguish wholesalers from regular retail customers by identifying consistent patterns in purchase volume and value.

### Add Column for Customer Level
```sql
ALTER TABLE valid_customers
ADD COLUMN customer_level VARCHAR(20);

UPDATE valid_customers
SET customer_level = 
  CASE
  WHEN invoice_count = 1 THEN 'One-Time'
  WHEN invoice_count < 3 AND customer_tenure_days < 30 THEN 'Short-Term'
  WHEN invoice_count >= 3 AND customer_tenure_days < 90 THEN 'Medium-Term'
  WHEN invoice_count >= 5 AND customer_tenure_days >= 90 THEN 'Recurrent'
  ELSE 'Occasional'
END;
```
**Insight:** Customers are categorized into engagement levels based on the number of days between their first and last transactions `customer_tenure_days` and their total number of invoices `invoice_count`. This segmentation helps classify them as One-Time, Short-Term, Medium-Term, Recurrent, or Occasional customers, providing a clearer understanding of purchasing behavior and loyalty.

### Product
#### Add Column for Product level
```sql
ALTER TABLE products
ADD COLUMN product_level VARCHAR(20);

UPDATE products
SET product_level = 
  CASE
    WHEN usual_price > 100 THEN 'Premium'
    WHEN usual_price > 50 THEN 'High'
    WHEN usual_price > 10 THEN 'Mid'
    WHEN usual_price > 1 THEN 'Standard'
    ELSE 'Low'
  END;
```
**Insight:** Products are categorized into tiers—Premium, High, Mid, Standard, and Low—based on their `usual_price` to reflect relative pricing levels and support more granular product analysis.

### Dates
#### Add columns for month_name and month_number
```sql
ALTER TABLE dates
ADD COLUMN month_number TINYINT,
ADD COLUMN month_name VARCHAR(10);

UPDATE dates
SET 
  month_number = MONTH(invoice_date),
  month_name = DATE_FORMAT(invoice_date, '%b');
  
  ALTER TABLE dates
MODIFY COLUMN month_number TINYINT AFTER invoice_date,
MODIFY COLUMN month_name VARCHAR(10) AFTER month_number;
```
**Insight:** Added month_number and month_name columns to enhance time-based analysis and enable proper chronological sorting in monthly reports.

#### Create Table for Months
```sql
CREATE TABLE months AS
SELECT 
  month_number,
  month_name,
  SUM(invoice_count) AS invoice_count,
  SUM(customer_count) AS customer_count,
  SUM(overall_quantity) AS overall_quantity,
  SUM(overall_spend) AS overall_spend
FROM dates
GROUP BY month_number, month_name
ORDER BY month_number;
```
|month_number|month_name                |invoice_count|customer_count|overall_quantity|overall_spend|
|------------|--------------------------|-------------|--------------|----------------|-------------|
|1           |Jan                       |1236         |1116          |268706          |473731.90    |
|2           |Feb                       |1201         |1079          |262227          |435534.07    |
|3           |Mar                       |1619         |1434          |343054          |578576.21    |

**Insight:** A dedicated months table was created to facilitate clearer analysis of monthly trends in customer activity, order volume, and revenue. This helps uncover seasonality and performance patterns across the year.
