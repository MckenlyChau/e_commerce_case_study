**Insight:** Several customers have an overall_spend of 0, which likely indicates full refunds or fully reversed transactions. Similarly, an overall_quantity of 0 may reflect historical refunds or data entry anomalies. Since these records do not provide meaningful analytical value, they may be excluded in later stages of the analysis.

**Insight:** The Regency Cakestand ranks among the top items by `overall_spend`, despite having a lower quantity sold compared to others. This suggests it is a high-value item. Categorizing products into high-end and low-end segments based on `usual_price` may provide more meaningful insights during analysis.

**Insight:** Most high-volume products are priced below $1, with only a few exceptions. This reinforces the value of segmenting items into low-end and high-end categories based on `usual_price` for more precise product-level analysis.

**Note** Product categorization was explored but deprioritized due to high variability in descriptions and limited benefit to core business insights.

**Insight:** Orders from the United Kingdom significantly surpass other countries in both quantity and total spend, which aligns with the dataset‚Äôs UK origin. Countries with fewer customers often exhibit a higher average spend per customer, suggesting that international sales may have been limited to wholesale buyers operating in their own domestic markets. It may be valuable to distinguish between domestic and international transactions for clearer segmentation.

**Insight:** The highest overall quantity and total spend are concentrated in the latter half of the year, indicating a potential seasonal trend. This pattern suggests increased purchasing activity during certain months, likely related to holidays or year-end demand. Further analysis by month and season will help validate and understand these trends.

- [üßÆ Add CLV Columns](#-add-clv-columns)

#### üß† Customer Segmentation by Type
<details>
<summary>Code</summary>

```sql
ALTER TABLE valid_customers
ADD COLUMN customer_type VARCHAR(20);

UPDATE valid_customers
SET customer_type = 
  CASE
    WHEN overall_quantity > 5000
         AND (overall_quantity / invoice_count) > 100
         AND overall_spend > 10000 THEN 'Wholesaler'
	WHEN overall_quantity > 2000
         AND (overall_quantity / invoice_count) > 50
         AND overall_spend > 1000 THEN 'Micro-Wholesaler'
    ELSE 'Retail'
  END;
```
</details>

**Insight:** Customers with an overall quantity exceeding 5,000, an average of more than 100 items per invoice, and total spending above 10,000 strongly indicate wholesale purchasing behavior. Meanwhile, those with over 2,000 items, an average above 50 per invoice, and spending above 1,000 suggest micro-wholesale activity. These thresholds help distinguish wholesalers from regular retail customers by identifying consistent patterns in purchase volume and value.

#### üìà Customer Segmentation by Engagement
<details>
<summary>Code</summary>

```sql
ALTER TABLE valid_customers
ADD COLUMN customer_level VARCHAR(20);

UPDATE valid_customers
SET customer_level = 
  CASE
  WHEN invoice_count = 1 THEN 'One-Time'
  WHEN invoice_count < 3 AND customer_tenure_days < 30 THEN 'Short-Term'
  WHEN invoice_count >= 3 AND customer_tenure_days < 90 THEN 'Medium-Term'
  WHEN invoice_count >= 5 AND customer_tenure_days >= 90 THEN 'Recurrent'
  ELSE 'Occasional'
END;
```
</details>

**Insight:** Customers are categorized into engagement levels based on the number of days between their first and last transactions `customer_tenure_days` and their total number of invoices `invoice_count`. This segmentation helps classify them as One-Time, Short-Term, Medium-Term, Recurrent, or Occasional customers, providing a clearer understanding of purchasing behavior and loyalty.

#### üßÆ Add CLV Columns
<details>
<summary>Code</summary>

```sql
ALTER TABLE valid_customers
ADD COLUMN customer_lifetime_value DECIMAL(10, 2),
ADD COLUMN estimated_clv DECIMAL(10, 2);

-- Historical CLV: Total spend per customer
UPDATE valid_customers
SET customer_lifetime_value = overall_spend;

-- Estimated CLV using customer_type and customer_level
UPDATE valid_customers
SET estimated_clv = 
  (overall_spend / NULLIF(invoice_count, 0)) *                           -- Average Order Value
  (invoice_count / NULLIF(GREATEST(customer_tenure_days, 1), 0)) *       -- Purchase frequency
  CASE 
    WHEN customer_level = 'One-Time' THEN 0				-- No lifetime value
    WHEN customer_type = 'Wholesaler' THEN 730
    WHEN customer_type = 'Micro-Wholesaler' THEN 365
    WHEN customer_level = 'Short-Term' THEN 60			-- customer_level used for segmenting Retail customers
    WHEN customer_level = 'Medium-Term' THEN 120
    WHEN customer_level = 'Occasional' THEN 180
    WHEN customer_level = 'Recurrent' THEN 365
    ELSE 180  -- Default fallback
  END; 
```
</details>

**Insight:** Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) was calculated by segmenting customers based on their engagement level and purchasing behavior. This approach provides a more tailored estimate of long-term value across Retail, Micro-Wholesaler, and Wholesaler segments.
</details>

#### üí∞ Product Tier Assignment by Price
<details>
<summary>Code</summary>

```sql
ALTER TABLE products
ADD COLUMN product_level VARCHAR(20);

UPDATE products
SET product_level = 
  CASE
    WHEN usual_price > 100 THEN 'Premium'
    WHEN usual_price > 50 THEN 'High'
    WHEN usual_price > 10 THEN 'Mid'
    WHEN usual_price > 1 THEN 'Standard'
    ELSE 'Low'
  END;
```
</details>

**Insight:** Products are categorized into tiers‚ÄîPremium, High, Mid, Standard, and Low‚Äîbased on their `usual_price` to reflect relative pricing levels and support more granular product analysis.

**Note** Product return rate was evaluated as a potential metric but ultimately excluded due to the absence of return reason data. Without understanding the context behind refunds (e.g., overordering, defects, or logistical issues), any conclusions drawn would be speculative. Product return rate was considered, but dropped due to not having information as to the cause of return which would have resulted in too much conjecture.

**Insight:** A dedicated refunds table was created by matching refund invoices to their corresponding purchases within a 14-day window. The matching logic allows a 15% tolerance in quantity and spend for most transactions, while applying a more lenient 50% tolerance for purchases under $50 to accommodate smaller discrepancies. A `refund_type` column was added to classify refunds as either Full or Partial, based on the proportion of value refunded relative to the original purchase.

#### üìú Historic Refunds Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE historic_refunds AS

  i.invoice_date,

  i.overall_quantity,

WHERE r.refund_invoice IS NULL
  AND i.transaction_types LIKE '%Refund%';
ALTER TABLE historic_refunds ADD PRIMARY KEY (invoice_no);
```
</details>

**Insight:** These refunds lack a corresponding purchase record within the dataset, suggesting they likely relate to transactions that occurred prior to the available data range.

**Insight:** This table enhances the original invoice data by incorporating customer classifications from the `valid_customers` table and leveraging both the `refunds` and `historic_refunds` tables to assign a clear refund status‚Äîidentifying whether a purchase was fully refunded, partially refunded, or represents a historic refund.

**Note** Recency is calculated using the most recent transaction date available in the dataset. An RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model was applied to enhance customer segmentation and analysis.
Customers with a tenure of 0 (one-time purchasers) or those classified as Churned have their estimated customer lifetime value (CLV) set to 0, reflecting minimal or no future engagement.
